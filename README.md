# coding_challenge
## Romell's WindRiver Coding Challenge

This readme provides the instructions to build and run the web service, this service was built using Python Flask, for more information check the official documentation at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/.

## Web Service Workflow

This Web service should accept a json document and execute a encrypt/decrypt procedure,it provides 3 Endpoints 

- /api/encrypt => Encrypt the value provided by the JSON document
- /api/decrypt => Decrypt the output from the encrypt endpoint
- /api/health => simple proof of liveness of the web service

## Build and Run in Docker

This repository contains the Dockerfile to build the image and run in any environment with Docker Installed, such as local computer - an EC2 instance - remote VM, follow the steps to build the image

1. Clone the repository using the `git clone` command and navigate into the root directory by running `cd coding_challenge`
2. Using `docker` command run `docker build -t flask:latest .` (be aware there is a dot at the end) this command will look for the Dockerfile inside the root directory and build the image providing the name and tag after the -t argument.
3. Once the process finishes, run the following command to create the container `docker run -dp 5000:5000 flask:latest`, docker run takes the image and create a container `-d` argument runs the container in detached mode or in the background for simple purpose, `-p` maps the ports between the host and the container following this format _host_port_:_container_port_
4. Access the application from outside system by using the *Container Host IP Address:5000* which is the port used by the application, you can grab this information by running the commands `ifconfig` for Linux or `ipconfig` for Windows machines, for instance the Host IP is 172.0.0.1 you can access the application by using 172.0.0.1:5000

## Run in Kubernetes

This repository contains the resource file to run the application in Kubernetes, this file named **kubernetes_deployment.yml** contains the necessary resources to deploy and expose the application, a Service kind NodePort should be created and expose the Pods created by the Deployment Object which runs 3 replicas of the Pods

## Docker Image Location

The official docker image can be found at the following link https://hub.docker.com/r/romellaguirre1008/flask-api or running the `docker pull` command `docker pull romellaguirre1008/flask-api`
